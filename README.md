# football_databricks
1. I loaded the kaggle transfermarkt files in manually into learning_catalog.raw_data schema in a new volume called landing
2. then read that using pyspark in a notebook

Thoughts so far
Learnt about notebooks
Tough to avoid AI don't want to distill the learning experience
Lots of components to remember and learn in databricks e.g. catalogs etc
